An interactive and professional data visualization project built using Python and Plotly Express to explore the classic Iris dataset. This project helps visualize the relationships between petal and sepal dimensions across different Iris flower species.

## 📊 Features

- Interactive scatter plots
- Color-coded species comparison
- Clear visual distinction between petal and sepal measurements
- Elegant, minimal design with dark theme
- Easy to run in Visual Studio or Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the classic **Iris dataset**, which includes:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
